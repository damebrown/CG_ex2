Q1:
Why do separate vertices for each face cause flat shading?

Answer to Q1:
In the process of this function we  calculate the averaged normal for each face.
Separating the vertices for each face causes the averaged normal of the vertices be exactly
the perpendicular vector to the plane spanned by the three vertices.
This causes the flat shading outline each faces' edges, as wanted in this type of shading.
